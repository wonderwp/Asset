# WonderWp Asset Component

A WonderWp package allowing you to work with assets. It helps you declare them, enqueue them, and work with external systems such as builders (webpack, gulp...) if needed.

## Documentation

- Declaring assets (the register part) works with Assets Services. Documentation about Assets Services can be found at [http://wonderwp.net/Creating_a_plugin/Services/Assets_service.html](http://wonderwp.net/Creating_a_plugin/Services/Assets_service.html).
- Then, using your assets within your theme (the enqueue part) works with Assets Enqueuers. Documentation about enqueuers can be found at [http://wonderwp.net/Framewok_components/Assets/index.html](http://wonderwp.net/Framewok_components/Assets/index.html)
